# Real-Time Chat App

This is a simple real-time chat application built using React for the frontend and Express with Socket.io for the backend. Users can type messages, send them, and see the received messages in real-time.

## Setup

### Frontend (React)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend (Express with Socket.io)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser (typically at http://localhost:5173).
2. Type your message in the input field.
3. Click the "Send Message" button to send the message.
4. Received messages will be displayed below the input field.

## Code Overview

### Frontend (`App.js`)

- Import necessary modules and set up a Socket.io connection.
- Use state variables to manage the input message and received message.
- Implement the `sendMessage` function to emit messages to the server.
- Use the `useEffect` hook to listen for incoming messages and update the UI.

### Backend (`server.js`)

- Set up an Express server with Socket.io integration.
- Enable CORS for communication with the React frontend.
- Handle socket connections and implement event listeners for sending and receiving messages.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Express
- Socket.io
- CORS

## Note

Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously for the application to work properly.

Feel free to modify and extend the application based on your requirements!
